# Uber-Fare-Prediction
I aimed to predict Uber fares using data on locations, passengers, and times. After detailed exploration and cleaning, I transformed timestamps and calculated travel distances. Multiple regression models were trained, evaluated, and compared. The project identified key fare influencers and the best-performing model for reliable fare predictions.
