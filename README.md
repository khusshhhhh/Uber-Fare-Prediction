**1. Data Exploration:**
<br/>
In this step, we delve deep into the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and the type of data it contains. We identify the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) which, in this case, is the fare_amount. We also look for any missing values, outliers, and understand the basic statistical properties of the dataset.<br/>

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
<br/>
EDA is a crucial step in any data science project as it helps in understanding the data's underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies. For the Uber dataset:

• We can visualize the distribution of fare_amount to see its spread and identify any outliers.<br/>
• We might also want to see how fares vary with the passenger_count.<br/>
• Using scatter plots, we can visualize the relationship between pickup and dropoff coordinates and the fare amount.<br/>
• Time-based analysis can be done on pickup_datetime to see if fares have any trend or seasonality.<br/>


**3. Data Pre-processing:**
<br/>
Before feeding data into any model, it's essential to ensure that it's clean and in the right format.

• Handle missing values: Depending on their nature, missing values can be imputed using mean, median, mode, or even more complex methods.<br/>
• Convert pickup_datetime into usable features. We might want to extract hour, day, month, and year as separate features as they can influence the fare.<br/>
• Outliers, especially in fare_amount or coordinates, should be dealt with as they can skew the model's predictions.<br/>


**4. Data Manipulation:**
<br/>
Here, we might want to create new features that might help in improving our model's accuracy.

• Calculate distance traveled: Using pickup and dropoff coordinates, we can compute the distance for each trip, which will be a significant determinant of fare.<br/>
• Time-based features: Extracting day of the week, weekend vs. weekday, etc., can provide more insights.<br/>


**5. Feature Selection/Extraction:**
<br/>
Not all features are equally important. Some might even be redundant.

• Use techniques like correlation analysis, Recursive Feature Elimination, etc., to select the most important features.<br/>
• Feature scaling: Standardize or normalize features, especially if using models like linear regression or SVM.<br/>


**6. Predictive Modelling:**
<br/>
This step involves training various regression models on the data to predict the fare.

• Split data into training and testing sets.<br/>
• Train models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, etc.<br/>
• Use cross-validation to ensure that the models generalize well on unseen data.<br/>


**7. Project Outcomes & Conclusion:**
<br/>
After training and evaluating different models, we can:

• Compare their performance using metrics like R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).<br/>
• Conclude which model works best for this particular dataset and problem statement.<br/>
• Provide insights into which features were the most important in determining fares.<br/>
• Discuss any challenges faced during the project and potential improvements that could be made in the future.<br/>
